Hi Firat, hope you are doing well. Just want to briefly explain each python module to you:

DATABASE.PY - I have used this module for making the database and accessing it

I have included three data cleaning techniques:
- formatting the dates
- handing missing purchase price values
- normalising the data by stripping "'" and making everything lowercase

I have made an execute method which all the other modules use for querying the database


GAMESEARCH.PY - This module searches the database

I have included functionality so that you can search for games without having to add the underscores and "'"
If you press the search button with no data, you can view all the games 

GAMERENT.PY - 

IMPORTANT NOTE: on my laptop, when i wanted to use the subscription manager and load the subscriptions, i had to use my own path for this to work.

When you test my code, please change the following code to your own path:

subscriptions = subscriptionManager.load_subscriptions("/Users/georgebrown/Documents/MASTERS/programming_project/Subscription_Info.txt") # My path

This module allows the user to rent a game by entering a customer id and game id and takes into account the subscription type.
This updates the database using the current date

GAMERETURN.PY - 

This module returns a game if it has been rented and then updates the database using the current date

GAMESELECT.PY -

This module included: 
- a function for showing the most popular games. This displays it as both a both a pandas object and matplot lib 
- a function for showing most popular genres. This displays it as both a pandas object and matplot lib 
- a function for suggesting games for purchase. This takes into account the most popular games and distributes the budget depending on how popular each game is
- I have added a feature which allows the user to add purchase games to the database with multiple copies of the same game. This gives each copy a unique ID


MAIN.IPYNB - 

This module shpws all the graphical user interface
